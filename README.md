# Exploring Multiple Tables of TV Series information with SQL 

In this project, I am apart of a tv show streaming service who wants to know more about their current show selection and what their users think of each series. I was assigned multiple tables of tv show information and fictional reviewer ratings of the show. I am using SQL database to demonstrate a few different ways in which SQL can be used to query data and answer business questiosn. 

The following is the list of tables and their corresponding column titles: 

- Reviewers (id, first_name, last_name) 
- Series (id, title, released_year, genre) 
- Reviews (id, rating, series_id, reviewer_id)
